This class is intended for individuals who want to step into the role of a Back-End Developer with international competency standards provided by AWS. By the end of the class, students will be able to independently create a simple RESTful API to support the functionality of an application.

Topics Covered:

-   **Introduction to Back-End:** : Explains the roles of front-end and back-end, how clients and servers communicate via the HTTP protocol, and the architecture of RESTful APIs in building web services. (3 Hours)

-   **Fundamentals of Node.js:** : Introduces Node.js and covers basics such as global and process objects, modularization, Node Package Manager (NPM), eventing, filesystem, and stream techniques. (8 Hours)

-   **Building Web Services using Node.js:** : Builds web services using Node.js natively and through the Hapi framework, creating a simple RESTful API. (10 Hours)

-   **Deploying Web Services:** : Introduces and uses Amazon EC2, operates Amazon EC2 via SSH, and runs the RESTful API on Amazon EC2. (5 Hours)

-   **Consuming and Testing RESTful APIs using Postman:** : Installs Postman, consumes RESTful APIs for testing purposes, and writes automated test scenarios using Postman. (5 Hours)
